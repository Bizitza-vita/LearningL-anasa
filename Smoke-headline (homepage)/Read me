Smoke-Headline CSS and JavaScript - jQuery for Elementor Pro
Purpose:
This code applies a "smoke" animation effect to text, making letters disappear and reappear in a smoky transformation when hovered.
How to Implement:
Add an HTML Widget in Elementor:

Drag and drop the HTML Widget into the desired section of your page.
Paste the complete code (both CSS and jQuery) provided above into the HTML widget.
Assign the smoke Class:

In the Elementor editor, add the smoke class to any widget or heading where you want the animation to occur.
Features:
Hover Effect: Each letter of the text animates with a smoky transformation when hovered.
Smooth Transitions: Letters disappear, blur, and reappear using keyframe animations.
Responsiveness: The effect adjusts based on screen size, maintaining an optimal display on different devices.
Notes:
jQuery Dependency: This script requires jQuery (which is included in the code via the <script> tag).
Text Wrapping: The jQuery script wraps each individual letter of the text in a <span>, enabling the animation on hover.
Customizable Animation: You can modify the keyframes or transition times to customize the smoke effect.
